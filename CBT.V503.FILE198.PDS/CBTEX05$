Hi Sam (Knutson),

I hope you are doing well and look forward to seeing you in
Seattle.  I have had to make some revisions to my JES2 dynamic
exit replacement code and was wondering if you could get it out
on the CBT tape for me.  Unfortuately, I don't think the changes
will work with prior 1.7 releases.  It's the PDSE JES target
library that screws things up.  So I don't know how you and Sam
Golob want to handle this.  I modified the copy found under the
JES2 section (File 140).  There is also a File 198 out there.  I
can't believe IBM did this.  I've been asking them for years to
pick up support of this and they still have not.  We will be
having a closed meeting Monday night about this (and a few other
things).  The failure is intermittent and I first found out about
it from a guy in Germany last week.  Please let me know if you
have any questions.

Thanks,
Bob Break
